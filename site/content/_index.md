      The t-shirt that started it all.  Given a hand-me-down silk screen press
      and ink from my old Boy Scout Master, we printed our first t-shirts in my
      parents garage in Marysville, OH.

  heading: Our Mission
  text: >+
    At Balance Through Art, we simply want to ask everyone the same question,
    "WHAT'S YOUR ART?"  We believe it is in the discovery and sharing of our
    individual talents that individuals will wake up to their unique calling in
    life, and our hope is that once awakened, artists will use their art to
    honor their Creator and use their art like medicine to heal and uplift those
    they share it with. 


    Our Mission can be summed up in 1 Corinthians 12:4-7 which states:

    4 There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit distributes them.
    5 There are different kinds of service, but the same Lord. 6 There are
    different kinds of working, but in all of them and in everyone it is the
    same God at work. 7 Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given
    for the common good.  (NIV)


    While this passage speaks specifically of spiritual gifts, we believe that
    God bestows different talents, abilities, and artistic expressions that
    should all be used to glorify He who gave them.

    Another passage in Corinthians states, "...whatever you do, do it all for
    the glory of God." (1 Cor 10:31 NIV).
